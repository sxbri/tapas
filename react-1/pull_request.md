I did the React challenge, took me 5-6 hours.

# Test instructions and expectations

```sh
npm install

npm run start
```
On localhost:3000, you will find the users' list.

# How does it work?

By clicking on a specific user, you can expand the element and see more informations about the selected user.
You can reorder the list by draggind and droping users.
The list is scrollable.

# Critical analysis
## General feeling

I liked the fact that we have to use different open source packages, it is more realistic and corresponds better to a real working environment.
I had never had the opportunity to use these and it was interesting to set up in this simple context.

I am satisfied with the functional aspect of what I have rendered, but I think I can improve it technically since this was my first experience with Hooks and React-JSS and I am aware that my implementation is not perfect on these points.

## Difficulties

I had to learn these new concepts and I still have work to do at this level.

## Strengths and weaknesses

My code is designed in a modular way, the elements of my solution are easily isolated and replaceable. The style is simple and effective, the animations are very basic but give a pleasant rendering.

An element of my solution has a component (UserList), which does not match 100% with the React Hooks implementation. This led me to apply the style of my list one element higher, on its parent (Content).

I need a learning time dedicated to these concepts before I can accurately estimate the amount of working time I have left in order to make my solution fully compliant with your expectations.
